### Resumen:

---

**Evolution AB develops, produces, markets, and licenses live casino and slots solutions to gaming operators primarily in Europe and the United States.** The gaming operators then market the products to their end users. Evolution’s customers include a majority of the most prominent online gaming operators worldwide, as well as several land-based casinos that
have expanded online.

In **Live Casino**, a game presenter (i.e., dealer) runs the game from a casino gaming table that is followed in real time via a video stream. End users (i.e., the players) make betting decisions on their devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.). EVO provides all aspects required by a gaming operator, from the recruitment and training of game presenters and other staff to streaming, production, supervision, customer services, and follow-up. EVO earns a commission of ~10% to 20% on gross gaming revenue (the operator’s customer losses) generated from its games.

# Macro:

---

🌎 Global Online Gambling Market CAGR of 12% until 2025

🌎 EEUU gambling market CAGR of 17.34% until 2026

🌎 Live and RNG is expected to grow faster than the online gambling market (CAGR of ~30%)

### Online Casinos Strong Growth Reasons:

- **Scale advantage →** Unlike on a land-based casino table where only a few people play at any one time, thousands of players from around the world play at the same time on an online casino table.
- **Increasing market regulation →** Contrary to many other industries, regulation attracts more operators and players.\*\*\*\*
- **Internet penetration and bandwidth capacity →** Since Live Casino requires high-quality video production and internet streaming capacity, until recently, this technology constraint delayed its growth.
- **Confidence in online payment solutions and mobile capacity →** Live Casino is seen as more engaging and trustworthy than graphical random number generator games like slots.

**Return to Player (RTP)** is what a game will pay players over time.

Si 100 personas juegan 1€, apostando en total 100€ y el dinero devuelto a los jugadores es de 96€ en total; el RTP es de 96%.

**RTP is also what induces players to spend time and money playing these games.**

Los casinos online pueden permitirse tener RTP's más altos debido a que carecen de muchos costes fijos.

On EVO-offered traditional casino games, RTP is high, while on EVO-developed game show games, RTP is low, allowing EVO to collect the cost of developing such games.

have expanded online.

The most basic agreements normally include access to, and streaming from generic tables, while more complex agreements can include dedicated tables and environments, VIP services, native speaking dealers and other customisations to produce a Live Casino experience that is as unique as possible for the end end user and helps the operator stand out from the crowd.

The majority of Evolution’s revenues consist of commission fees and fixed fees for dedicated tables, which are paid monthly by operators. Commission is calculated as a percentage of the operators’ winnings generated via the company’s Live Casino offering. Through commission, Evolution gains beneficial exposure to the general growth of the Live Casino market.

Dedicated table fees are monthly service charges to operators who have opted to provide dedicated tables for their end users. Dedicated tables are reserved and used exclusively by the operator, and can be customised completely to the operator’s requirements as regards studio environment, graphics, brand attributes and language. The fee varies from customer to customer depending on factors such as the type of game, number of tables and active hours.

In addition to commission and dedicated table fees, there are other smaller sources of income such as set-up fees, which are invoiced to new customers in conjunction with the launch of their Live Casino offering.

### 📖 **Cost Structure:**

Evolution’s largest cost items are personnel costs and costs relating to facilities and production studios. Personnel costs are primarily related to staff and recruitment within operations, as well as IT and product development.

The cost of adding an additional gaming operator to the company’s Live Casino platform or expanding an existing customer’s offering varies depending on the extent of the agreement. Set-up fees cover some of the cost for new studios and environments.

Product innovation and development also constitutes a material cost item, both directly in terms of operating expenses, and indirectly, through depreciation of capitalised development costs

### 📖 **Strategy:**

- Product innovation
- Customer optimisation
- Operational excellence

✅ **Experiencia regulatoria** → Es más probable que una marca con reputación consiga las licencias, y además ya han consigo varias licencias en el pasado.

✅ **High Switching Costs**

→ Dedicated tables with EVO can cost tens of thousands of dollars and the average contract length is ~3 years. If a casino operator were to let their contract with EVO expire, the **operators would lose their upfront investment in their dedicated tables.**

→ Certain dealers are quite popular with customers. If a casino operator wants to let its contracts with EVO expire, not only will it lose EVO’s games, but it **will also lose access to EVO’s dedicated and non-dedicated dealers**. Not having the original dealers that many players develop comfort and loyalty to could cause immediate churn off the casino operator’s platform.
